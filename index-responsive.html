			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr>
			<p class="shortBio"><img class="myimage" src="assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Eric">I am a programmer who hails from the town of Conway in New Hampshire. Ever since I was two years old, I have been working with computers, then when I was five, I was working on them. I started my first website when I was in eighth grade using Google Sites. It wasn't anything fancy, but had dozens of pages based on how to fix your computer and how to perform certain functions using batch files and command prompt (Sounds exciting). I hosted my own website directly from my room with an old Dell Poweredge 2400 with a Pentium 3 processor back in 2010 or 2011. After about 48 hours of extremely loud computer fans, I shut it down and went to another online host. Now, I don't have my own website, but I maintain one for a homeowners association that I used to live in. During high school, I dabbled in Python 3 and the C programming languages, as well as robotics using the VEX robotics systems, and even entering a few of them into the VEX Robotics competitions.</p>
